Full-stack software developer with extensive experience in current technologies, always seeking new challenges. 

My approach is focused on delivering quality, autonomy in problem-solving, and a constant pursuit of technical and personal improvement. With a critical and analytical mindset, I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges, aiming for increasingly efficient and robust solutions in the projects I participate in.
